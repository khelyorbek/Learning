- Writing SQL Commands
- Other relational databases will use a 99% similar syntax
- SQL is case sensitive. 'Bob' is not the same as 'bob'
- Single quotes around string. Not double quotes
- Everything ends with a semicolon. If you don't put a ; at the end of any command, IT WILL NOT EXECUTE
- SQL commands are usually written in ALL CAPS like SELECT * FROM movies
--- SELECT price FROM books 
--- is exactly the same as 
--- select price from books
- It just makes it easy to distinguish SQL commands from variable / table / database names because SQL commands are in ALL CAPS
