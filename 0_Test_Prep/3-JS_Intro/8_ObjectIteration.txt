To iterate over objects, we use a for in loop. - FOR IN
!!! FOR OF DOES NOT WORK ON OBJECTS !!!

    let instructor = {
        name: "Matt",
        mathWizard: true,
        dogOwner: true
    };

    for(let singleKey in instructor){
        console.log(instructor[singleKey]);
    }

    // the loop will log:
    // "Matt"
    // true
    // true

In the code example, singleKey is a variable that will be assigned to each key in the instructor object. To access the key's value, we must use the bracket notation.

if...in: Determining If a Key Exists in an Object
Sometimes, we just want to check and see if a certain key exists in an object. To do that we use a if...in statement. Here is an example
    let obj = {
        favoriteNumber: 33,
        favoriteColor: 'blue'
    }

    if ("favoriteNumber" in obj){
        console.log("The favoriteNumber key exists!");
    }
