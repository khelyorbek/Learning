Typography
To help with responsive design, Bootstrap version 4 uses rem units for all typography. On the body tag, Bootstrap sets the font-size to 1rem, with a line-height of 1.5. You can also use classes like lead or text-muted simple, standardized styling of text that you may want to emphasize in different ways. There are also a number of inline https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#inline-text-elements text elements for additional modification. The documentation has an entire section on typography, which you can check out here. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/

Buttons
Buttons are one of the most common elements you'll be using with Bootstrap. You can use Bootstrap's buttons to help build forms, style links, and, of course, create nice looking button elements.

Bootstrap has quite a few default colors and sizes for buttons. You can read all about buttons in Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/. Check out this quick example: https://codepen.io/mmmaaatttttt/pen/qPaLpJ?editors=1000

As you can see, there are quite a few different classes you can give to your buttons. The base styles come from the btn class, but you won't really use this class in isolation: instead, you'll typically combine it with one of the other classes, such as btn-primary or btn-success. This is very similar to the pattern we've seen with alerts.

Buttons also come with a family of outline classes, which can be helpful if you want to use color more sparingly in your design.

Also, note that you can add button classes to a few different elements, including button, input, and a tags. Adding button classes to a tags is really helpful if you want to make a link look like a button. Aside from this case, however, the Bootstrap documentation recommends that wherever possible, you should try to use the button element when using button styles (because of cross-browser compatibility issues).

Also, note that by default buttons are inline-block elements. If you want a block-level button, give it a class of btn-block. You can also change the default size of the button by using btn-lg or btn-sm classes. Note that Bootstrap 3 also had a btn-xs class, but this has been removed in version 4.
