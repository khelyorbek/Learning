Icons
Before taking a look at some other Bootstrap components, let's briefly talk about icons. Prior to version 4 of Bootstrap, the library came with a built in icon library callled glyphicons. However, this icon library has been removed in version 4, and instead you're encouraged to use an external library for icons if you need it. 

The Bootstrap docs https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/extend/icons/ have a list of icon libraries that they recommend, including Iconic https://useiconic.com/open/. One very popular library that they don't mention is Font Awesome http://fontawesome.io/.

Example of icon usage: https://codepen.io/mmmaaatttttt/pen/PJpqxz?editors=1000

Note that for both of these libraries, icons are displayed by adding classes to certain inline elements. For Iconic icons, every icon should have the oi class, plus an additional class for the specific icon, such as oi-thumb-up or oi-person. The pattern for Font Awesome is similar; the biggest difference is that the class prefixes are fa (for Font Awesome) instead of oi.

Navbar
Bootstrap makes it very easy to add styled navigation to a website with its navbar component. You can see how it looks here (we've toned down the example from the docs https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/ a bit to make it easier to digest): https://codepen.io/mmmaaatttttt/pen/VMWZwQ?editors=1000

Some of these classes should look familiar. And even among the new ones, some common patterns exist. For example, even though the nav element has a lot of classes attached to it, the color options you have for nav bars are the same as the ones we've seen for things like alerts and buttons.

As this example shows, you can also add inline forms to your nav bars.

This navbar is responsive, but also broken. Notice that if you narrow the width of the screen, eventually everything inside of the div with a class of navbar-collapse disappears, and is replaced with a button on the right side of the nav. But if you click on the button, nothing happens! Here's our first example that requires more than CSS: in order to use the responsive nav bar that Bootstrap provides, we need to include some JavaScript as well.

Bootstrap JS
While Bootstrap is a CSS Framework, it comes with some handy JavaScript to add dynamic interactivity to your page. Fortunately, to get started with this you do not need to know any JavaScript (unless you would like to customize some of these things). However, you must know that bootstrap.js depends on two other libraries: jQuery and Popper.js. Therefore, we need to include both of these dependencies before loading the Bootstrap JavaScript file. Here's what that looks like (you can also find this in the docs): https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-KJ3o2DKtIkvYIK3UENzmM7KCkRr/rE9/Qpg6aAZGJwFDMVNA/GpGFF93hXpG5KkN" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.11.0/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-b/U6ypiBEHpOf/4+1nzFpr53nxSS+GLCkfwBdFNTxtclqqenISfwAzpKaMNFNmj4" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0-beta/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-h0AbiXch4ZDo7tp9hKZ4TsHbi047NrKGLO3SEJAg45jXxnGIfYzk4Si90RDIqNm1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

If you add these script tags at the bottom of our nav bar example (right before the closing body tag), you should see that the button in the navbar works! On small screens, the navigation collapses, but you can expand it by clicking on the button.

Other Components
Once you've included the JavaScript files that Bootstrap needs, there a number of other components you can use. These include carousels https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/, modals https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/modal/, popovers https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/popovers/, and tooltips https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/tooltips/. Try to get the code examples from the Bootstrap docs working in your own HTML files!

Bootswatch
One of the downsides of using Bootstrap is that it's very easy to identify sites that are styled with Bootstrap. Fortunately, Bootswatch is a wonderful open source set of themes for Bootstrap to add some more customization and flavor so that your page doesn't look like every other Bootstrap page. You can think of Bootswatch themes as different skins for Bootstrap; the code you write will be the same regardless of the theme, but the end result on the page will look different. There are Bootswatch themes available for version 4 and version 3 of Bootstrap. You can find the version 4 themes here https://bootswatch.com/

To include a Bootswatch theme, you can click the "Download" button and copy the CSS to a file and link to it using a link tag. You can also access the themes via CDN here. https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/

A word of advice
As with many tools, it's easier to read through the Bootstrap documentation and feel like you understand it than it is to implement Bootstrap's features in practice. The best way to reach mastery using Bootstrap is, well, to use Bootstrap. A lot. Build some simple webpages and add a couple of Bootstrap components. Break things and fix them. These chapters should hopefully serve as a useful reference, but the only way you'll learn how to use Bootstrap is to practice using Bootstrap regularly.
