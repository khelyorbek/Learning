Tables
Bootstrap can quickly turn your tables into very nice and even responsive ones! By default, though, Bootstrap doesn't do much. Take a look at the following example: https://codepen.io/mmmaaatttttt/pen/jGMXjL?editors=1000

Forms
Bootstrap also gives you a whole suite of classes for building forms, both horizontally and with a block layout. Here's a basic example of a form styled with Bootstrap: https://codepen.io/mmmaaatttttt/pen/QqKYda?editors=1000

The most important thing to remember when building forms with Bootstrap is to use the form-group for each part of the form. The elements used to collect information from the user (input, select, and so on) are also typically given a class of form-control.

You can also align form groups horizontally by giving the groups a class of row, and giving elements inside of the group column classes. For labels, you should also add the col-form-label class to ensure that the label is vertically aligned properly.
Here's the same form as above, styled horizontally: https://codepen.io/mmmaaatttttt/pen/aLmXWr?editors=1000

Check out the docs https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/ if you'd like to dig deeper. For now, though, it's important to remember that you shouldn't worry about trying to memorize the syntax, class names, and so on. That's what the documentation is for! Instead, if you want to practice, use the documentation as a starting point. Try building a couple of forms based on the docs, playing around with classes, and seeing what sorts of variants you can come up with.
