In your .html file - type in ! and press tab and this should appear:

If you want to nest tags inside of others you can use the > symbol. For example, typing div>span and pressing tab should produce <div><span></span></div>. Once again, your cursor should show up in the middle.

Emmet Shortcuts
One of the nice things you can do with emmet is write HTML quickly! Get started by typing h1 and pressing tab. You should see <h1></h1> with your cursor in the middle!

If you want to nest tags inside of others you can use the > symbol. For example, typing div>span and pressing tab should produce <div><span></span></div>. Once again, your cursor should show up in the middle.

If you want to add text inside a tag you can use the {} braces and then press tab. Emmet converts h1{Hello World} to <h1>Hello World</h1>.

If you want to create multiple tags you can use the * operator.

p>div{inner}*2 produces:

<p>
  <div>inner</div>
  <div>inner</div>
</p>

You can also create sibling elements (remember, these are elements with the same direct parent) using the + operator.

div+p>span produces

<div></div>
<p>
  <span></span>
</p>
What about attributes? Emmet's got you covered there as well! You can pass in an attribute name and value between square brackets.

div[id="hello"]{Hi everybody!}>span{Yo}*3 produces

<div id="hello">Hi everybody!
  <span>Yo</span>
  <span>Yo</span>
  <span>Yo</span>
