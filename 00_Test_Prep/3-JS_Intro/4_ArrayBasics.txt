To write an array in JavaScript, you use square brackets [] and comma separate each value in the array. Here are some examples:
    let primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];
    let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];
    let booleans = [true, false, false, true];
    let mixedTypes = [1, "sweet", true, null, NaN, "bye!"];
    let woahhh = ["What's up with this? -->", ["Woah", "crazy!"]];
    let emptyArray = [];

Find the length of an array: .length

Adding to arrays
There are a number of ways you can add elements to an array.

One way is by setting a value at a new index in the array.
    let arr = [1,2,3];
    arr[3] = 4;
    arr; // [1,2,3,4]

Be careful with this approach, though -- you can add an element at any index, and any elements that don't have values in them will be filled with undefined values.
    let arr = [1,2,3];
    arr[5] = "whoa";
    arr; // [1, 2, 3, undefined, undefined, "woah"]

ADD TO THE END OF ARRAY - PUSH
    let arr = [3, 2, 5];
    arr.push(7); // returns the new length, i.e. 4
    arr; // [3, 2, 5, 7]

ADD TO THE BEGINNING OF ARRAY - UNSHIFT
    let arr = [1,2,3];
    arr.unshift(0); // returns the new length, i.e. 4
    arr; // [0,1,2,3]

Removing from arrays
REMOVE FROM  THE END OF ARRAY - POP
    let arr = [1,2,3];
    arr.pop(); // returns 3
    arr; // [1,2]

REMOVE FROM THE BEGINNING OF ARRAY - SHIFT
    let arr = [1,2,3];
    arr.shift(); // returns 1
    arr; // [2,3]

SETTING index of array to undefined - DELETE
    let arr = [5, 4, 3, 2];
    delete arr[1];
    arr; // [5, undefined, 3, 2]

Removing/Adding or both with splice
The splice method accepts at least two arguments. 
    The first argument is the starting index, indicating where values will be removed or added. 
    The second parameter is the number of values to remove. 
    Optionally, you can pass in an unlimited number of additional arguments; these correspond to values you'd like to add to the array. 
    The splice method always returns/outputs an array of the removed elements. Here are some examples:
        let arr = [1,2,3,4];
        arr.splice(0,1); // returns [1]
        arr; // [2,3,4]

        let arr = [1,2,3,4];
        arr.splice(0,1,5); // returns [1]
        arr; // [5,2,3,4]

        let arr = ["a","b","c","d"];
        arr.splice(1,2,"x","y","z"); // ["b", "c"]
        arr; // ["a", "x", "y", "z", "d"]
