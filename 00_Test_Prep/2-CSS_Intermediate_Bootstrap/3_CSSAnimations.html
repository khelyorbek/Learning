To create our animation, we need two things: an animation property on the relevant HTML element, and a set of keyframes that describe the animation we're trying to build. Keyframes literally describe key frames in the animation, around which the animations take place. For example, there are three key points in the animation above: when our div is a red circle, when it's a blue square, and when it's a green (rotated) square.

When you're creating custom animations using keyframes, you need to give your animation a name before you build it. In this case, since our shape is changing, let's call our animation shapeshift.

There are actually 8 sub-properties that you can set inside of animation https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/
