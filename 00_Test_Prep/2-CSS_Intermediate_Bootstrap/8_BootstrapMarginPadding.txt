Margin and Padding
In the previous example, we saw how Bootstrap classes like mr-auto and ml-auto could be used to add margin to elements on the page.

Bootstrap comes with a number of classes to help add space between elements on the page. These elements all come in the form {property}{sides}-{size} or {property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}, where property, sides, breakpoint, and size are one of the following:

property: m (margin) or p (padding)

sides: t (top), b (bottom), l (left), r (right), x (left and right), or y (top and bottom). You can also leave this value blank to target all directions.

breakpoint: sm, md, lg, or xl. You can also leave this value blank to target xs.

size: a number from 0 to 5. Larger numbers indicate more space.

Here's a quick example highlighting some of these classes. As you can see, these classes allow to quickly add margin or padding to elements on the page without needing to modify a stylesheet.

  <div class="alert alert-primary px-5 py-md-3">I have lots of padding (but slightly less on medium screens)!</div>
        padding right and left of 5 (highest)
        padding top and botton on midsize screen of 3 (medium)


    <div class="alert alert-danger p-0 m-0">I have neither margin nor padding :(</div>
        padding on all sides 0
        margin on all sizdes 0

    
  <div class="alert alert-success pt-5 pb-0 pl-2 pr-4 mt-0 ml-5 mr-1 mb-5">My spacing is all over the place!</div>
        padding top = 5
        padding bottom = 0
        padding left = 2
        padding right = 4
        margin top = 0
        margin left = 5
        margin right = 1
        margin bottom = 5
